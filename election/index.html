<p>I typically publish an elections forecast for every major election cycle on major statewide and national races. Below are the links to the forecasts (and post-election analyses) from previous years.</p>
<p><a title="2019" href="2019">2019</a></p>
<p><a title="2018" href="2018/senate">2018</a></p>
<p><a title="2017" href="2017">2017</a></p>
<p><a title="2016" href="2016/president">2016</a></p>

<h2>Related Analysis</h2>
<p>These analyses provide insights as to how well my models did retrospectively and how they could compare to other election models and forecasts, such as RealClearPolitics and FiveThirtyEight.</p>

<h2><a title="Election Results Live Stream" href="results">Election Results and Forecasts Live Stream</a></h2>
<p>I normally stream live results and analysis, along with a live forecast of the election, at <a title="Election Results Live Stream" href="results">this page</a> for major elections, with a schedule of when I intend to do them. The next scheduled stream is for the Louisiana gubernatorial jungle primary on Saturday, October 12, 2019, at 21:00 EDT, though no commentary this time.</p>
