<h1>2024 Presidential Election Results</h1>
<hr />
<!--<h3>| Home | </h3>-->
<div class="description">
<p>Former President Donald J. Trump (R-FL) won reelection amidst economic and social anxiety and an unpopular Biden presidency, despite polls against Vice President Kamala D. Harris (D-CA) forecasting to be the most uncertain presidential election in the electoral college since 2000. President Trump won the key battleground states in the Midwest of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, where polls had shown a dead heat, by winning over swing voters in working class neighborhoods, cutting into traditionally Democratic margins in urban areas, and expanding Republican margins in rural areas.</p><p>In 49 out of 50 states, there are models shown with the results below indicating each model's best estimate of the final result in that state based on its political geography. These models likely give a better sense of who is winning in each state than the actual raw vote count. In many ways, these models are similar to the New York Times Election Needle, but differ in the respect that these models each give its own estimate of the final outcome as opposed to a single confidence interval of the outcome. Each model has its vulnerabilities, and I strongly caution against reading too much from these models until we have a significant sample of votes reporting from different parts of the state and the models have converged and are holding steady. <a href="../../../2024/results">This page</a> has more details on the models, such as what the models and the 'status' in each state mean and what are the strengths and vulnerabilities of each model.</p><p>In addition to the results on this webpage, live analysis on the results with the models is being streamed on Twitch at <a href="../../../2024/results">the same page linked above</a> on election night, November 5, starting at 6:00 PM EST.</p><p>Note that results are refreshed about every 10 minutes, and hence the map will reset at this interval to load the latest data.</p>
